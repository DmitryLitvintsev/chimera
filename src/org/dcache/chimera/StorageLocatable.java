-- Generic storage information

-- ilocation : type specific information like pool name for disk and HSM connetion for tape
-- ipriority : in case of multiple locations of hint for performance or other needs
-- ictime    : location creation time
-- iatime    : last access time, probably performance killer, but nice to have for statistics
